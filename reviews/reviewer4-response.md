# Response to reviewer 4

>1. Several key quantities and symbols such as Cp and U are used in the introduction prior to their definitions later in the manuscript. Please define quantities and symbols near first instance of use.



>2. Results are presented and discussed with those from a previous study of a similar turbine. For ease of comparison, please add the UNH-RVAT parameters to Table 2.



>3. It would be helpful to see Figure 8 with the UNH-RVAT results on the same axes or as additional plots, as they are referred to in the results section and in the conclusions.



>4. Virtual camber of blades is discussed in the results section, where it is suggested it plays a role in Re-convergence. Reference 9 is used here, which links to a data repository. The claims using this reference are therefore hard to verity. Is there an additional source to back this up?



>5. Figure 10 shows power losses due to strut drag, both plotted as function of tip-speed ratio. Have you confirmed these losses collapse with TSR? i.e., for equal TSR but different combinations of U and $\omega$, do you get the same result? Similarly, how is TSR defined for a ‘stationary’ test?

These strut drag measurements were only performed at a tow speed of 1 m/s, a
detail which has been added to the manuscript. There will be some Reynolds
number dependence of these losses, following from the Reynolds number effects on
the drag of a cylinder, but we have not investigated that here. We expect that
the absolute values of the losses would change, but their scaling behavior with
$\lambda$ should not change significantly.

We computed $C_P$ and TSR using the same reference velocity as for the towed
case (1 m/s). This detail has been added to the text.
