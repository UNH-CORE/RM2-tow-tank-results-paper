# Response to reviewer 3

>1. In the title, please use “Hydrokinetic turbine” instead of only “turbine”

We have changed the title accordingly.

>2. Consider adding sample time histories of torque and drag force for extreme cases (high and low lambda).

This is possible, though we do not think it would add much value to the
discussion. However, the data and code to plot these values is freely available
if readers are curious, or would like to perform a more detailed validation of,
e.g., their performance predictions.

>3. In Figure 10 Cp is plotted versus lambda for a stationary case. If U is zero how does Cp or even Lambda is defined?

We computed $C_P$ and TSR using the same reference velocity as for the towed
case (1 m/s). This detail has been added to the text.

>4. In line 123, it should be “… dependence were…” instead of “… dependence of was…”

Thank you. The text has been corrected.

>5. In line 151, Fig. 4 should be Fig. 3.

This cross-reference has been fixed.

>6. In lines 303 and 304 refer to Fig. 9 again to help the reader follow the discussion easier.

This cross-reference has been added to the text.

>7. In line 314, refer to Fig. 11 before Fig. 12.
>8. In line 320, refer to Fig. 13 before Fig. 14.

The figure order has been corrected in the manuscript such that they are
referred to sequentially.

>9. In line 360, it must be “…likely due to…” instead of “…likely to due…”.

Thank you. This has been corrected in the manuscript.

>10. In Fig. 1, show c and R in the plot.

We have added these dimension labels to the turbine drawing.
