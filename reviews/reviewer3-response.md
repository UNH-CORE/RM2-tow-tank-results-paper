# Response to reviewer 3

>1. In the title, please use “Hydrokinetic turbine” instead of only “turbine”



>2. Consider adding sample time histories of torque and drag force for extreme cases (high and low lambda).



>3. In Figure 10 Cp is plotted versus lambda for a stationary case. If U is zero how does Cp or even Lambda is defined?

We computed $C_P$ and TSR using the same reference velocity as for the towed
case (1 m/s). This detail has been added to the text.

>4. In line 123, it should be “… dependence were…” instead of “… dependence of was…”

Thank you. The text has been corrected.

>5. In line 151, Fig. 4 should be Fig. 3.

This cross-reference has been fixed.

>6. In lines 303 and 304 refer to Fig. 9 again to help the reader follow the discussion easier.

This cross-reference has been added to the text.

>7. In line 314, refer to Fig. 11 before Fig. 12.
>8. In line 320, refer to Fig. 13 before Fig. 14.

The figure order has been corrected in the manuscript such that they are
referred to sequentially.

>9. In line 360, it must be “…likely due to…” instead of “…likely to due…”.

Thank you. This has been corrected in the manuscript.

>10. In Fig. 1, show c and R in the plot.
