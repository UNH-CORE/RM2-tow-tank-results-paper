# RM2 tow tank results paper

This repository is for the first paper describing the results from the 1:6
scale RM2 tow tank experiment at UNH.

The current plan is to write only about the experimental results, describing
them in a very matter-of-fact way, and submit to PLOS ONE. Note that according
to their [guidelines](http://www.plosone.org/static/latexGuidelines), figures
should be in TIFF format, and should not be included as part of the submitted
PDF. References also need to be contained in `paper.tex` rather than as a
separate *.bib or *.bbl file.
