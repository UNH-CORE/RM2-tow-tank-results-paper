\section*{Introduction}
Sandia National Laboratory (SNL) developed the cross-flow turbine, Reference
Model 2 (RM2), to provide an open-source point design for MHK research and
development, including its use as a test object for scaled model testing to
generate power performance data that can be used to validate open-source design
tools. More details on the reference modeling effort are provided in Neary et
al. \cite{Neary2014}.

Dimensional analysis provides scaling laws that are used to upscale model test
data into performance and design information for a full-scale prototype turbine.
For hydrokinetic turbines, hydrodynamic similitude is achieved when the Reynolds
number, Froude number and tip-speed-ratio of the model and the full scale device
match. The Reynolds number is defined as
\begin{equation}
Re_L = \frac{UL}{\nu},
\label{eq:Re}
\end{equation}
where $U$ and $L$ are characteristic length scales, and $\nu$ is the fluid
kinematic viscosity. The Froude number is defined as
\begin{equation}
Fr = \frac{U}{\sqrt{gL}},
\label{eq:Fr}
\end{equation}
where $g$ is the gravitational acceleration, and the tip speed ratio is defined
as
\begin{equation}
\lambda=\frac{\omega R}{U_\infty},
\end{equation}
where $\omega$ and $R$ are the rotor angular velocity and radius.
For hydrokinetic turbine testing, $Re$, not $Fr$, is the dominant scaling
parameter. However, the Froude number (based on blade tip submergence) should
remain small (significantly below one). It is rare to achieve perfect similitude
for $Re$, but a threshold value should be exceeded, such that scale model
results can be extrapolated.

As a cross-flow turbine, the RM2 blades will experience large variations in
angles of attack as they rotate about their axis (``cross-flow turbine'' means
the axis of rotation is perpendicular to flow direction---either vertically or
horizontally). These variations become larger as the tip speed ratio decreases
\cite{Para2002}. Typically, the maximum angles of attack are sufficiently large
that the blades operate under dynamic stall, which is a complex unsteady process
and deviates significantly from static foil behavior, during part of the
rotation. Furthermore, the higher the solidity of a cross-flow turbine, the
lower the optimal tip-speed ratio at which it operates. Marine Hydrokinetic
(MHK) cross-flow turbines typically have higher solidity than cross-flow wind
turbines (VAWT), and hence operate at lower tip-speed ratios. Since MHK turbines
operate in a higher density fluid, unsteady dynamic effects related to the
blades' pitching motion and flow curvature also become more important when
compared to wind turbines.

The performance of cross-flow MHK turbines thus depends on both Reynolds number
and solidity (note that these issues are related, since an average blade chord
Reynolds number, $Re_{c,\mathrm{avg}} \approx \lambda U_\infty c/ \nu$, can be
expressed in terms of tip speed ratio, the optimal value for which is a function
of solidity). If numerical models are validated with physical model data that
was obtained at insufficiently high Reynolds numbers, it cannot be determined
whether problems with model predictions are caused by Reynolds number effects,
issues related to higher solidity, or both. It is uncertain whether numerical
models validated with physical model data obtained at low Reynolds number should
be considered validated at all, since the scale at which the model will be
applied is orders of magnitude larger. One way to overcome this uncertainty is
to show that the scaled physical model test has become Reynolds number
independent, and therefore validation efforts should be relevant at full-scale.

For example, the effect of Reynolds number on average power output was shown to
be significant on the 2 m Sandia Research Darrieus turbine in wind tunnel
testing \cite{Blackwell1976}: Maximum power coefficient, $C_{P,\mathrm{max}}$,
increased with Reynolds number, $Re_c$, along with a shift of the location of
$C_{P,\mathrm{max}}$ toward lower tip speed ratios due to delayed blade stall.
The effects of Reynolds number were quite dramatic over a relatively small range
of $Re_c \approx 1.1 \times 10^5$--$2.9 \times 10^5$. More recently, Bachant and
Wosnik \cite{Bachant2014} showed that turbine performance and near-wake
characteristics become Reynolds number independent at $Re_c \approx 2 \times
10^5$.

The need for experimental data that is relevant to full-scale behavior stems
from the need to validate numerical models---most importantly mid-fidelity
models---desirable for MHK developers to predict the performance of their
cross-flow turbine designs, since physical modeling at appropriate scales can be
prohibitively expensive in the early stages of engineering. Furthermore,
Navier--Stokes-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations require
modeling in 3 dimensions, which generally necessitates high performance
computing---a resource that is not commonly available, and more expensive.

To date, attempts to validate SNL's mid-fidelity CACTUS vortex line model
\cite{Murray2011} have relied on measurements from the Saint Anthony Falls
Laboratory (SAFL) \cite{Hill2014} and the University of New Hampshire (UNH)
\cite{Neary2013, Michelen2014}. For the SAFL experiments (RM2), the chord
Reynolds number, $Re_c \sim 10^4$, was below the threshold needed to properly
simulate lift and stall characteristics. For the UNH experiment
\cite{Bachant2013}, the chord Reynolds number was sufficiently high at $Re_c
\approx 2.7 \times 10^5$, but the chord/radius ratio and solidity (13.4\%)
created instability in the free-wake evolution in the model, which caused
significant overestimation of power coefficient.

The present task was to acquire a new dataset for the lower solidity RM2
turbine, but at higher Reynolds numbers than those achieved in the experiments
at SAFL. It is also suspected that the strut drag model in CACTUS could be the
source of some discrepancy. The strut drag was deliberately modified in the
physical model to provide data to help answer that question. This dataset is
publicly available for both validation of CACTUS and other numerical models.


\section*{Materials and Methods}

\subsection*{Turbine Model}

% For figure citations, please use "Fig." instead of "Figure".
A 1:6 scale model of the RM2 rotor was designed and built. Turbine geometric
parameters were scaled from the RM2 ``rev 0'' design report \cite{Barone2011},
with the exception of the shaft diameter, which was scaled from the SAFL RM2
shaft \cite{Hill2014}. The hubs were designed to be similar to the SAFL model,
which may aid in comparison of the results, though this was not a top priority.
Geometric parameters are shown in Tab.~\ref{tab:turb-geom} and a drawing of the
turbine design is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:turbine-drawing}. The turbine model
components---blades, struts, shaft, and center hub sections---were fabricated
from 6061-T6 aluminum, which was hardcoat anodized per MIL-8625-A, type III,
class 2 specifications. CAD models of the turbine are available from
\cite{Bachant2015-RM2-CAD}.

\subsection*{Facility and instrumentation}

Experiments were performed in the UNH tow/wave tank, a 36 m long facility with a
3.66 m wide by 2.44 m deep cross-section, capable of tow speeds up to 3 m/s,
pictured in Figure~\ref{fig:tow-tank}. The turbine was mounted in a frame built
from NACA 0020 struts, attached to the tow carriage by four linear bearings,
which transfer all streamwise force to a pair of S-beam load cells. The turbine
shaft RPM was controlled by a servo motor system, which allowed prescription of
the turbine tip speed ratio. The load torque was measured by an inline rotary
torque transducer and a load cell mounted at a fixed distance from the servo
motor, providing a redundant measurement. Turbine shaft angle was measured using
the servo drive's emulated encoder output, set to $10^5$ counts per turbine
shaft revolution. Carriage speed, and therefore inflow velocity was measured
using a linear encoder with 10 $\mu$m resolution. All of these
performance-related quantities were sampled as 2 kHz, while the tow tank's
motion controller provided redundant measurements of the carriage speed and
turbine angular velocity sampled at 1 kHz. Turbine wake measurements at 1 meter
downstream were measured with a Nortek Vectrino+ acoustic Doppler velocimeter,
sampling at 200 Hz. A drawing of the experimental setup is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:exp-setup}.

\label{fig:exp-setup}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Synchronization.} The three data acquisition instrumentation
subsystems---motion controller, NI DAQ (performance measurements), and Vectrino+
(wake velocity measurements)---started sampling at precisely the same time each
tow, after being triggered by a TTL pulse created by the motion controller. This
strategy retained synchronization for all performance signal samples (tow speed,
torque, drag, angular velocity), ensuring precise calculation of, e.g., power
coefficient. Since there is also synchronization of the initial sample from each
three subsystems, correlation of events in the performance and wake signals is
also possible.

\paragraph{Tare drag and torque compensation.} Tare torque and drag runs were
performed to measure the shaft bearing friction torque and turbine mounting
frame drag, respectively. Tare drag runs were performed for each tow speed in
the experiment, for which the mean value was used in data processing. Tare
torque runs were performed by rotating the turbine shaft (without blades) in air
at constant angular velocity for a specified duration, over the range of angular
velocities used throughout the experiment. Tare torque was fit with a linear
regression versus shaft angular velocity, and added to the measured turbine
torque in post-processing.


\subsection*{Test parameters}

Data collection runs were separated into individual tows, for which all
independent variables---tow speed, tip speed ratio, velocity probe
position---were held constant. These runs were grouped into logical test matrix
``sections,'' in which typically a single independent variable was varied.

\subsection*{Wake characteristics}

The mean velocity field at a tip speed ratio $\lambda=3.1$, 1 m downstream
($x/D=0.93$) is plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:meancontquiv}. The mean streamwise
velocity deficit is markedly more symmetric than that of the UNH-RVAT, with
lower acceleration around the turbine thanks to lower rotor drag coefficient and
blockage ratio \cite{Bachant2015-JoT}. We also see that the effects of blade tip
vortex shedding are relatively weaker.

\begin{figure}[h]
%\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/meancontquiv}
\caption{{\bf Near-Wake Mean Velocity Field.}

$\lambda=3.1$.}
\label{fig:meancontquiv}
\end{figure}


Fig.~\ref{fig:kcont} shows the turbulence kinetic energy in the turbine wake. We
mainly see unsteadiness in the flow generated by the blade tip vortex shedding
(the horizontal band around $z/H=0.5$). Compared with the UNH-RVAT, turbulence
generation is lower overall, without the intense vertical band around $y/R=-1$,
which indicated that the RM2 blades are operating further from
stall---consistent with the higher tip speed ratio operation.

Turbulence kinetic energy at 1 m downstream ($x/D=0.93$), $U_\infty=1.0$ m/s, and

\label{fig:kcont}
\end{figure}


Totals for the transport terms in the mean kinetic energy equation---analyzed
identically to \cite{Bachant2015-JoT}---are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Ktransport}.
Due to the weaker blade vortex shedding, we see transport due to vertical
advection at this point in the wake is approximately 3 times lower than the
higher solidity UNH-RVAT. We also see relatively lower levels of cross-stream
turbulent transport thanks to the lack of blade stall vortex shedding. These
results may have interesting implications regarding the application of turbines
with lower power coefficient to possibly improve overall array performance
through enhanced transport of kinetic energy from the free stream, though a
detailed anaylsis of the downstream evolution and turbine interaction will be
necessary.
